1. Scala Basics: Binding and Scope. For each the following uses of names, give the line where
that name is bound. Briefly explain your reasoning (in no more than 1â€“2 sentences).
(a) Consider the following Scala code.
1 val pi = 3.14
2 def circumference(r: Double): Double = {
3 val pi = 3.14159
4 2.0 * pi * r
5 }
6 def area(r: Double): Double =
7 pi * r * r
The use of pi at line 4 is bound at which line? The use of pi at line 7 is bound at which
line?


Answer : The use of pi at line 4 is bound at line 3
		 The use of pi at line 7 is bound at line 1



(b) Consider the following Scala code.
1 val x = 3
2 def f(x: Int): Int =
3 x match {
4 case 0 => 0
5 case x => {
6 val y = x + 1
7 ({
8 val x = y + 1
9 y
10 } * f(x - 1))

The use of x at line 3 is bound at which line? The use of x at line 6 is bound at which
line? The use of x at line 10 is bound at which line? The use of x at line 13 is bound at
which line?

Answer : The use of x at line 3 is bound by line 2
		 The use of x at line 6 is bound by line 2
		 The use of x at line 10 is bound by line 2
		 The use of x at line 13 is bound by line 1
